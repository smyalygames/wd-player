1
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.287
Most people consider
themselves animal lovers.

2
00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:11.891
We recognise them not as objects

3
00:01:12.123 --> 00:01:14.919
but as complex beings with
whom we share the planet,

4
00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:16.974
our lives,

5
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:19.004
our homes.

6
00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:21.977
We take pleasure from their pleasure,

7
00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:24.140
we anguish over their pain

8
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.881
celebrating their intelligence
and individuality

9
00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.212
as we welcome them into our families,

10
00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:32.311
or revere them in their natural element.

11
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.200
The thought of unnecessarily causing them
harm or suffering, is to many, unbearable.

12
00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:42.288
So for those who feed,
clothe or entertain us,

13
00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:44.931
we choose to follow a
narrative that minimises

14
00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:47.189
or altogether eliminates
their suffering.

15
00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:52.065
The picturesque family farm and
the iconic, loving farmer.

16
00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:58.010
A humane and painless end, a small price
happily paid for a life well lived.

17
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.406
An arrangement of mutual benefit.

18
00:02:03.184 --> 00:02:06.717
Hidden by this narrative,
out of sight, out of mind,

19
00:02:06.742 --> 00:02:10.109
they cease to be individuals,
most known only as livestock,

20
00:02:10.134 --> 00:02:14.284
faceless units of production in a
system of incomprehensible scale,

21
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.737
exempt from the cruelty laws that
protect our companion animals.

22
00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:21.085
Their suffering
unseen and unheard.

23
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.342
Their value determined only by
their usefulness to humankind,

24
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.600
rationalised by a belief
in our own superiority

25
00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:30.785
and the notion that
might equals right.

26
00:02:31.198 --> 00:02:33.798
A notion that must be questioned.

27
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.983
In the 1960s, there were around
50,000 pig farms in Australia.

28
00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:45.233
Today, there are less than 1400,

29
00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:49.646
and yet the total number of pigs bred
and slaughtered for food has increased.

30
00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:56.395
As of 2015, 49 farms housed 60% of
the country's total pig population.

31
00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:08.093
Most pigs bred for food begin
life in a farrowing crate,

32
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:10.701
a small pen with a central cage,

33
00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:14.123
designed to allow the piglets
to feed from their mother, the sow,

34
00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:16.818
while preventing her from moving around.

35
00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:24.568
The frequency of stillborn
or mummified piglets

36
00:05:24.593 --> 00:05:27.802
generally increases with each litter
as the sows' bodies become less

37
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:32.131
capable of handling the large litter
sizes encouraged by the industry.

38
00:05:32.818 --> 00:05:37.818
10-18% of piglets who are born alive
won't make it until weaning age,

39
00:05:38.054 --> 00:05:41.064
succumbing to disease,
starvation or dehydration,

40
00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:44.826
or being accidentally crushed
by their trapped mothers.

41
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.096
Included in the death toll
are the runts of the litter,

42
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.846
who are considered economically
unviable and killed by staff.

43
00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:32.930
Those who survive the first few days
are mutilated without pain relief,

44
00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:36.018
their tails and teeth cut
to reduce cannibalism...

45
00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:44.337
and pieces cut from their ears, or tags
punched in, as a means of identification.

46
00:06:46.177 --> 00:06:49.388
They are taken from their
mothers at 3-5 weeks of age.

47
00:06:51.897 --> 00:06:55.564
Most are destined for slaughter
around 5 months later.

48
00:07:10.092 --> 00:07:15.092
As they age, they are moved into grower
pens, crowded together in their own waste.

49
00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:41.991
Some female pigs are kept on to replace
the sows in the breeding cycle,

50
00:07:42.043 --> 00:07:46.299
carefully selected for their perceived
ability to produce large litters.

51
00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:51.420
Most pig farms utilise artificial
insemination rather than natural mating,

52
00:07:51.444 --> 00:07:56.005
as it allows them to impregnate up to
30-40 female pigs from a single boar.

53
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.916
Workers collect the semen
by masturbating the boars,

54
00:08:00.538 --> 00:08:04.678
then insert it into the sows via a
raised catheter known as a pork stork.

55
00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:20.136
Boars are still physically used to excite
the females prior to insemination,

56
00:08:20.163 --> 00:08:22.405
but are prevented from actually mating.

57
00:08:32.725 --> 00:08:36.843
When confirmed pregnant, the sow is moved
into one of two types of confined housing

58
00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:39.431
for the entirety of her 16 week gestation.

59
00:08:41.913 --> 00:08:45.959
Sow stalls are individual cages in
which, like in the farrowing crates,

60
00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:49.315
sows are only able to take one or
two steps forwards or backwards

61
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.893
and are unable to turn around.

62
00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:56.179
While gradually being phased out by the
majority of piggeries in Australia,

63
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.686
sow stalls remain entirely legal with no
penalties for keeping sows confined to them

64
00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:03.525
for longer than the
voluntary limit of 5 days.

65
00:09:03.895 --> 00:09:08.010
This is similar to the apparent "ban"
on sow stalls in the European Union

66
00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:11.199
which actually allows up to 4
weeks in them per pregnancy.

67
00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:13.960
When given the choice, pigs
will relieve themselves

68
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.167
far away from where they sleep and eat.

69
00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:22.030
The extreme confinement takes
a heavy psychological toll.

70
00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:29.977
The alternative, group housing,

71
00:09:30.016 --> 00:09:33.232
sees pregnant pigs packed
into small concrete pens.

72
00:09:36.761 --> 00:09:40.475
A lack of space and stimuli can cause
the pigs to become aggressive.

73
00:09:47.049 --> 00:09:50.193
Those who fall into the effluent
system through gaps in the flooring

74
00:09:50.218 --> 00:09:52.656
are left to starve or drown
in the river of waste.

75
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.355
A week before they are due to give birth,

76
00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:00.777
they're moved into the
farrowing crate cages,

77
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.574
where they'll remain for
the next 4-6 weeks.

78
00:10:06.859 --> 00:10:09.783
Unable to exercise, the sow's
muscles will weaken to the point

79
00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:12.452
where she has difficulty
standing up or lying down...

80
00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:17.941
To minimise muscle wastage, workers will
force her to stand up at least once daily.

81
00:10:24.194 --> 00:10:27.230
She'll develop pressure sores
from the hard surfaces...

82
00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:33.059
Or prolapses and infections
from the physical strain

83
00:10:33.084 --> 00:10:35.388
of repeated farrowing and poor conditions...

84
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.782
... which can also lead to partial paralysis,

85
00:10:45.807 --> 00:10:49.189
preventing her from reaching the food
and water at the front of her cage...

86
00:10:56.768 --> 00:10:59.100
... or can even lead to death in the cage.

87
00:11:03.944 --> 00:11:07.205
She'll watch helplessly as her
piglets fall ill and die,

88
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:16.235
or get mutilated and abused by workers
until they are taken away from her.

89
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.795
She'll endure this cycle
four times over two years

90
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.221
before she's replaced
and sent to slaughter,

91
00:11:39.246 --> 00:11:41.189
or killed and dumped on site.

92
00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:19.696
The term "bred free range" simply means
that pigs are born outside in small huts,

93
00:12:19.837 --> 00:12:22.259
but then spend the rest
of their lives in sheds,

94
00:12:22.357 --> 00:12:27.357
facing the same overcrowding, health and
behavioural issues as at any pig farm,

95
00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:29.888
whilst being knee deep in their own waste.

96
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:41.130
Capable of living 10-12 years, most
pigs are killed at just 5-6 months old,

97
00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:43.451
packed onto transportation
trucks at the piggery

98
00:12:43.476 --> 00:12:46.022
and driven often long distances
to the slaughterhouse

99
00:12:46.047 --> 00:12:50.128
without food, water or protection
from extreme heat or cold.

100
00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:58.666
At the slaughterhouse they'll wait in
small concrete or metal holding pens,

101
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:03.691
typically overnight, still without food
and with limited or no access to water.

102
00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:10.334
In the morning, they are forcefully
herded to the kill floor,

103
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.101
often with an electric prodder.

104
00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.892
The most common method of stunning
and killing pigs in Australia,

105
00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:19.806
used at all major pig abattoirs and touted
as the most "humane" and efficient option,

106
00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:21.888
is the carbon dioxide gas chamber.

107
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.168
A system of rotating cages lowers the
fully-conscious pigs two or three at a time

108
00:14:29.193 --> 00:14:31.251
into the heavily
concentrated gas,

109
00:14:31.767 --> 00:14:35.693
which begins to burn their eyes,
nostrils, sinuses, throat and lungs

110
00:14:35.718 --> 00:14:37.384
while suffocating them.

111
00:15:29.702 --> 00:15:33.619
Lower concentrations of carbon dioxide
would cause less pain and stress,

112
00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:36.550
but would take much longer to
render the pigs unconscious,

113
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:38.849
making it economically unviable.

114
00:15:40.016 --> 00:15:43.219
Sows are sent into the chamber
gondolas one at a time.

115
00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:52.338
Because of their size, the
gas is less effective,

116
00:15:52.676 --> 00:15:54.752
with some emerging partly conscious,

117
00:15:54.777 --> 00:15:57.674
in which case they may also be
electrically stunned afterwards.

118
00:15:58.655 --> 00:16:00.472
Tipped out the other
side of the chamber,

119
00:16:00.497 --> 00:16:02.941
the pigs' throats are cut
and they are bled out.

120
00:16:19.665 --> 00:16:22.734
Electrical stunning, used
at smaller slaughterhouses,

121
00:16:22.789 --> 00:16:24.697
has a much higher chance of failure.

122
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:59.287
Incorrect amperage, positioning of the
stunner, or length of time applied,

123
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.807
or failing to cut the
throat quickly enough,

124
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.781
can lead to the pig being merely
paralysed and unable to move

125
00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:08.038
while still capable
of feeling pain,

126
00:17:09.334 --> 00:17:11.755
or regaining consciousness
while bleeding out.

127
00:17:29.021 --> 00:17:32.570
Blinking and rhythmic breathing are
strong indicators of consciousness.

128
00:17:37.524 --> 00:17:40.372
One by one, they are picked
off in front of each other.

129
00:17:56.176 --> 00:18:00.048
Captive bolt pistols are another option
used by smaller slaughterhouses.

130
00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:04.033
The penetrative variety fire a rod
through the skull of the animal

131
00:18:04.088 --> 00:18:05.645
to permanently damage their brain,

132
00:18:05.723 --> 00:18:07.888
preventing them from
regaining consciousness,

133
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:12.664
while non-penetrative bolt pistols deliver
blunt force trauma much like a hammer.

134
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.128
Effective stunning requires the
gun to be angled and positioned

135
00:18:36.161 --> 00:18:37.444
at the correct part of the head,

136
00:18:37.862 --> 00:18:40.418
which is often difficult if
the head is not restrained.

137
00:18:56.963 --> 00:18:59.709
Having witnessed their litter
mates being killed before them,

138
00:18:59.734 --> 00:19:01.990
or being able to smell
the blood on the floor,

139
00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:04.118
they are reluctant to
enter the knockbox.

140
00:19:44.663 --> 00:19:48.341
The bolt gun is even less effective
on larger pigs, like sows.

141
00:19:58.467 --> 00:20:01.152
For them, a rifle may be
used as an alternative.

142
00:20:01.386 --> 00:20:03.864
In this case, accuracy
is even more difficult.

143
00:20:40.604 --> 00:20:44.191
After they've been bled out, pigs are
dropped into tanks of scalding water

144
00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:47.439
in order to soften their skin
and remove bristles and hair.

145
00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:58.058
Those who haven't been stunned and
killed properly finally die by drowning.

146
00:21:51.396 --> 00:21:55.563
The waste products - the skins,
bones, hoofs, guts and fat -

147
00:21:55.652 --> 00:21:59.056
are trucked to the rendering
plant to be turned into lard

148
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:02.537
for use in food, soaps,
lubricants and biofuel,

149
00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.453
or into other products like gelatine.

150
00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:09.329
Wild pigs were introduced to
Australia with the First Fleet,

151
00:22:09.517 --> 00:22:12.150
and now occupy around 40
percent of the country,

152
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:14.527
mainly in Queensland and New South Wales.

153
00:22:14.913 --> 00:22:19.064
The practice of "pig dogging" involves
hunters releasing aggressively trained dogs

154
00:22:19.098 --> 00:22:21.410
to track, chase and maul live pigs,

155
00:22:21.772 --> 00:22:22.827
keeping them pinned down

156
00:22:22.852 --> 00:22:25.967
until the hunters are able to catch
up and finish them off with a knife.

157
00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:08.651
Despite wild pigs being
declared a pest animal,

158
00:23:08.687 --> 00:23:12.251
it's not uncommon for hunters to release
young piglets into national parks

159
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.271
so that they can return later to hunt them.

160
00:23:39.888 --> 00:23:43.337
For egg-laying hens, life
begins at the hatchery.

161
00:23:45.106 --> 00:23:50.106
Eggs collected from the parent birds are
stored, incubated and hatched over 31 days.

162
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:10.054
The male and female chicks are
sorted onto separate conveyor belts.

163
00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:13.650
Here at Australia's largest hatchery,
they've been genetically modified

164
00:24:13.675 --> 00:24:18.160
to make the males a different colour than
the females, allowing for quick sorting.

165
00:24:18.372 --> 00:24:20.972
Unable to ever produce eggs themselves

166
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.018
and a completely different breed
to the chickens used for meat,

167
00:24:24.043 --> 00:24:26.473
the male chicks are
considered waste products,

168
00:24:26.498 --> 00:24:29.578
as are any females perceived
to be deformed or weak.

169
00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:33.113
They are sorted onto a separate
conveyor belt from the healthy females

170
00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:38.138
in their first day of life, and sent into
an industrial blender called a macerator.

171
00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:51.070
This practice is legal and referred
to as humane by the RSPCA.

172
00:24:52.227 --> 00:24:55.227
Smaller hatcheries may
use carbon dioxide gas

173
00:24:55.247 --> 00:24:58.014
or simply suffocate the
chicks in plastic bags.

174
00:24:59.647 --> 00:25:01.030
All commercial egg farms -

175
00:25:01.055 --> 00:25:05.678
caged, barn laid, free range,
organic, RSPCA-approved -

176
00:25:05.812 --> 00:25:07.832
involve the killing of male chicks,

177
00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:11.632
to a total of roughly 12
million per year in Australia.

178
00:25:25.507 --> 00:25:30.441
Meanwhile, the healthy females continue
on to painful debeaking machines.

179
00:25:30.668 --> 00:25:34.061
Hens are debeaked to minimise the
harm they can do to each other

180
00:25:34.073 --> 00:25:35.802
in the confinement of egg farms.

181
00:25:41.707 --> 00:25:45.858
The chicks are then stacked in trays
and trucked to pullet rearing farms,

182
00:25:45.883 --> 00:25:49.024
where they'll remain for 4 months
until they begin laying eggs.

183
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:53.727
A small number of males will
be spared the macerator

184
00:25:53.851 --> 00:25:57.143
in order to serve with a selection
of hens as parent birds,

185
00:25:57.168 --> 00:25:59.646
laying and fertilising the
eggs for the hatchery.

186
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.553
The other hens are sent out to
egg farms across the country.

187
00:26:23.178 --> 00:26:28.178
Around two-thirds of the 18 million layer
hens at any given time in Australia

188
00:26:29.028 --> 00:26:30.894
are housed in battery cages.

189
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:36.460
Each shed can contain up to 100,000
hens, with between 4 and 20 per cage,

190
00:26:37.914 --> 00:26:41.786
each hen afforded a space smaller
than a A4 sheet of paper.

191
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:46.051
They are unable to stretch their wings
or express any natural behaviours

192
00:26:46.132 --> 00:26:49.068
such as dust bathing,
perching or foraging.

193
00:26:55.091 --> 00:26:58.852
Due to decades of genetic
manipulation and selective breeding,

194
00:26:58.929 --> 00:27:03.562
they lay an egg almost every day
for a total of up to 330 per year,

195
00:27:03.642 --> 00:27:06.733
compared to the 10-15 that
a wild hen would lay.

196
00:27:07.267 --> 00:27:11.606
As they age, the poor environment and
physical stress of frequent egg-laying

197
00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:16.040
takes a toll on their health, indicated by
the gradual loss of all of their feathers

198
00:27:16.253 --> 00:27:19.586
and an increasingly pale
comb suggesting anaemia.

199
00:27:20.476 --> 00:27:22.518
Deaths inside the cages are common,

200
00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:27.016
and due to the size of the facilities can
be easily missed for long periods of time

201
00:27:27.268 --> 00:27:30.828
forcing the surviving hens to live
on top of the rotting carcasses.

202
00:27:31.617 --> 00:27:36.460
Newer cage systems collect the faeces
onto conveyor belts beneath the cages,

203
00:27:36.525 --> 00:27:39.431
while older systems allow
it to pile up underneath.

204
00:27:44.877 --> 00:27:49.877
Birds who manage to escape the cages
are left to die in these manure pits.

205
00:27:53.525 --> 00:27:58.042
At 18 months of age, after living in the
cage for over a year, their egg production

206
00:27:58.067 --> 00:28:01.267
will have slowed significantly
enough to be considered "spent".

207
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:05.790
They are "depopulated" - pulled from
the cages and stuffed into crates,

208
00:28:05.835 --> 00:28:08.964
often resulting in bone fractures
due to rough handling.

209
00:28:18.712 --> 00:28:22.272
They are either gassed to death
and then buried or rendered,

210
00:28:22.461 --> 00:28:26.824
or sent to the slaughterhouse, and
replaced by new 4-month old hens.

211
00:28:29.492 --> 00:28:31.571
Up until 2016,

212
00:28:31.583 --> 00:28:35.500
there were no national standards on
what can be claimed as free range eggs.

213
00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:39.453
Now, free range farms are capped
at a maximum outdoor density

214
00:28:39.465 --> 00:28:43.069
of 10,000 hens per hectare
- one per square metre -

215
00:28:43.094 --> 00:28:46.487
though they still spend most of their
time packed together in large sheds.

216
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.703
Chickens naturally form and live within a
social hierarchy called a pecking order,

217
00:28:56.748 --> 00:29:00.140
but are only able to recognise
around 100 other chickens.

218
00:29:00.218 --> 00:29:03.168
In sheds or paddocks with
thousands of other birds,

219
00:29:03.202 --> 00:29:06.838
their inability to maintain this
pecking order results in chaos.

220
00:29:06.861 --> 00:29:09.584
The weak birds are picked
on with no way to escape.

221
00:29:09.911 --> 00:29:11.629
Disease spreads rapidly.

222
00:29:12.872 --> 00:29:17.872
An outbreak of avian influenza at a New
South Wales free range egg farm in 2013,

223
00:29:18.981 --> 00:29:21.328
believed to be contracted from wild ducks,

224
00:29:21.348 --> 00:29:24.568
led to the culling of
over 400,000 farmed hens.

225
00:29:26.037 --> 00:29:30.847
Many of the larger free range farms also
have cage farms on the same property,

226
00:29:30.986 --> 00:29:34.144
with the eggs from both ending
up in the same packing shed.

227
00:29:34.508 --> 00:29:39.189
A 2009 analysis of Egg Corporation
data indicated that as many

228
00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:44.214
as one in six eggs sold as "free range"
were laid by caged or barn hens.

229
00:29:46.008 --> 00:29:47.703
As with caged farms,

230
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.766
free range hens are sent to slaughter
from just 18 months of age,

231
00:29:51.933 --> 00:29:54.725
far short of their 10
year natural lifespan.

232
00:29:57.095 --> 00:30:01.580
At the slaughterhouse, the hens are
shackled upside-down on a moving line.

233
00:30:09.925 --> 00:30:13.675
They are lowered into a bath of
electrified water to stun them

234
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.814
prior to their throats being
cut by an automated blade,

235
00:30:17.203 --> 00:30:20.595
but if they lift their heads,
they can miss the stun bath,

236
00:30:20.966 --> 00:30:22.996
facing the blade fully conscious

237
00:30:27.223 --> 00:30:30.917
and ultimately drowning in scalding
water further down the process.

238
00:30:35.519 --> 00:30:39.638
The slaughtered hens largely end up
in lower-grade chicken meat products

239
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:44.375
such as mince, or rendered into
poultry meal for use in pet food

240
00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:46.716
or to be fed back to farmed animals.

241
00:31:10.527 --> 00:31:13.011
Chickens bred for meat, known as broilers,

242
00:31:13.034 --> 00:31:14.596
are a larger breed than egg layers,

243
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:18.412
designed through human intervention
to grow rapidly to massive sizes.

244
00:31:20.838 --> 00:31:23.360
Their short life begins
at a broiler hatchery.

245
00:31:26.478 --> 00:31:28.974
While both the males and females
are used by this industry,

246
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.457
these hatcheries also use macerators...

247
00:31:36.134 --> 00:31:37.499
or gas chambers,

248
00:31:37.524 --> 00:31:40.950
for weak or deformed birds who aren't
expected to make it to slaughter weight.

249
00:32:54.098 --> 00:32:58.159
The surviving day-old chicks are
trucked to broiler grow-out farms.

250
00:33:43.985 --> 00:33:48.032
As of 2016, there were 530
broiler farms in Australia,

251
00:33:48.057 --> 00:33:52.965
together housing at any given time a total
population of around 90 million birds.

252
00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:56.238
Each shed holds forty-to-sixty thousand.

253
00:33:59.004 --> 00:34:03.266
Within their first week of life, a
mortality rate of 4-6% is normal,

254
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:08.370
equating to 1600 to 3600 dead chicks
per shed, roughly 200-500 daily.

255
00:34:12.052 --> 00:34:14.974
The majority of these will have
been found dead by workers,

256
00:34:14.998 --> 00:34:18.418
others who seem weak or injured
will be killed or tossed out alive.

257
00:35:47.843 --> 00:35:51.156
As they grow, they quickly fill out
the available space in the shed,

258
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:53.777
living amongst a buildup
of their own faeces.

259
00:36:00.754 --> 00:36:04.224
The mortality rate slows, but deaths
are still a regular occurrence.

260
00:36:16.964 --> 00:36:20.481
Not far from the sheds, the bodies
are piled up and composted.

261
00:36:54.951 --> 00:36:58.179
Selective breeding, lack of
exercise due to overcrowding,

262
00:36:58.219 --> 00:37:02.475
artificial lighting and the heavy use of
antibiotics which enhance feed absorption,

263
00:37:02.547 --> 00:37:04.531
have resulted in modern broiler chickens

264
00:37:04.551 --> 00:37:08.418
reaching a slaughter-ready weight
of 3 kilograms in just 35 days,

265
00:37:09.157 --> 00:37:13.747
a dramatic increase from a
natural peak of 2kg in 96 days.

266
00:37:15.182 --> 00:37:18.951
Their bodies have great difficulty
handling this extreme physical pressure,

267
00:37:18.976 --> 00:37:22.237
making skeletal, cardiac and
metabolic disorders common.

268
00:37:24.312 --> 00:37:29.203
Of those who make it to the slaughterhouse,
90% have a detectable abnormal gait.

269
00:37:32.605 --> 00:37:35.987
The sheds are not cleaned for
the entire 5 to 7 week cycle,

270
00:37:36.066 --> 00:37:40.213
causing a high concentration of ammonia
which can irritate and burn their skin

271
00:37:41.404 --> 00:37:43.665
and impede their respiratory system.

272
00:37:59.718 --> 00:38:02.467
Chickens sold under the
RSPCA approved label

273
00:38:02.492 --> 00:38:05.127
are given a single perch running
down the middle of the shed,

274
00:38:05.152 --> 00:38:08.073
but otherwise the conditions
and process are identical.

275
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.521
Depopulation occurs in low light
conditions in the middle of the night,

276
00:39:05.546 --> 00:39:08.731
when the birds are calmest and
unable to see what's happening.

277
00:39:09.077 --> 00:39:11.749
They are typically caught
by hand by contract teams

278
00:39:11.774 --> 00:39:13.543
and jammed into plastic crates,

279
00:39:13.568 --> 00:39:17.339
the crates then forklifted onto trucks
for transport to the slaughterhouse.

280
00:39:58.009 --> 00:40:02.208
Like layer hens, they are hung roughly by
their legs onto the automated shackle line...

281
00:40:06.908 --> 00:40:09.060
then dipped into the electric stun bath,

282
00:40:10.791 --> 00:40:14.311
with any birds who lift their
heads proceeding fully conscious

283
00:40:15.996 --> 00:40:19.234
before having their throats
cut open by a rotating blade.

284
00:40:30.275 --> 00:40:34.038
A worker stands by with a knife for
any birds who miss the first blade.

285
00:41:31.666 --> 00:41:33.704
Farmed turkeys have
been selectively bred

286
00:41:33.744 --> 00:41:36.935
to grow so large that they
cannot naturally mate,

287
00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:40.138
so the turkey industry relies
on artificial insemination,

288
00:41:40.163 --> 00:41:42.490
shown here at a free range farm in Victoria

289
00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.199
though considered standard practice

290
00:41:44.217 --> 00:41:47.239
at the small number of
Australian turkey hatcheries.

291
00:41:52.441 --> 00:41:56.508
Highly inquisitive birds, they are
raised in much the same way as broilers,

292
00:41:56.533 --> 00:42:01.533
with 10-14000 per shed equating
to six turkeys per square metre.

293
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:12.961
Genetic alterations and artificial
lighting to maximise feeding,

294
00:42:13.038 --> 00:42:16.498
contribute to a growth rate double
that of their wild counterparts.

295
00:42:16.569 --> 00:42:20.169
They rapidly reach a weight
their legs cannot support.

296
00:43:11.594 --> 00:43:15.692
Living in their own waste, wounds
can quickly become infected.

297
00:43:38.761 --> 00:43:41.245
The frequency of deaths
increases with age

298
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:44.050
to an average rate of 3-5% for females

299
00:43:44.075 --> 00:43:47.107
near the end of their 12
week lifespan in the sheds,

300
00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:51.741
and 10-12% for males near the
end of their 16 week lifespan.

301
00:43:59.295 --> 00:44:02.272
The dead birds are collected
and dumped like rubbish.

302
00:44:18.321 --> 00:44:20.359
The rest are trucked to the slaughterhouse,

303
00:44:24.676 --> 00:44:26.619
where they are punched, kicked and beaten

304
00:44:26.644 --> 00:44:29.993
while being shackled upside-down
onto the slaughter line.

305
00:44:46.302 --> 00:44:49.918
Smaller slaughterhouses may
use individual killing cones.

306
00:45:15.153 --> 00:45:18.203
4 to 5 million are killed
every year in Australia,

307
00:45:18.267 --> 00:45:21.515
most of which is purchased and
consumed around Christmas.

308
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:25.847
For the rest of the year, or even for
years at a time, they are frozen.

309
00:46:14.553 --> 00:46:18.015
As with broiler chickens, macerators
are still used in duck hatcheries

310
00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.086
for the weak or deformed ducklings who
aren't expected to survive the grow-out.

311
00:46:30.047 --> 00:46:33.675
Duck farming shares many similarities
with broiler and turkey farming.

312
00:46:37.259 --> 00:46:39.358
Trucked from the hatchery
on their first day of life,

313
00:46:39.383 --> 00:46:43.279
the ducklings are grown at an
accelerated rate over just 7 weeks,

314
00:46:43.362 --> 00:46:45.121
housed with thousands of others

315
00:46:45.146 --> 00:46:48.572
in rarely-cleaned sheds where
disease and fatalities are common.

316
00:46:59.728 --> 00:47:03.191
Ducks are aquatic animals, so they
naturally have weak leg and thigh joints

317
00:47:03.216 --> 00:47:07.022
as they don't normally need to hold their
body weight for extended periods of time.

318
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.973
Where surface water is available,
ducks will float for long periods,

319
00:47:12.998 --> 00:47:16.265
reducing pressure on their
muscular and skeletal system.

320
00:47:17.163 --> 00:47:19.281
However, when surface water is denied,

321
00:47:19.306 --> 00:47:23.300
as in most Australian farms including
those labelled as free range,

322
00:47:23.456 --> 00:47:27.355
ducks must hold their entire body
weight on their legs for up to 7 weeks

323
00:47:27.535 --> 00:47:30.262
- often much longer for
ducks kept for breeding -

324
00:47:30.494 --> 00:47:34.102
resulting in lameness, dislocated
joints and broken bones.

325
00:47:36.555 --> 00:47:39.414
Selective breeding aimed at
growing ducks faster and heavier,

326
00:47:39.532 --> 00:47:41.900
coupled with the
insufficient bone formation

327
00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.936
of their juvenile skeletal system,

328
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:47.781
adds even more pressure on their
already weak leg and thigh joints.

329
00:47:58.563 --> 00:48:00.772
Without water for even dipping their heads,

330
00:48:00.837 --> 00:48:04.040
ducks are unable to keep their
eyes, nostrils and feathers clean,

331
00:48:04.065 --> 00:48:06.682
worsening the risk of disease or blindness.

332
00:48:13.674 --> 00:48:17.021
Living in their own waste and the
resulting high levels of ammonia

333
00:48:17.045 --> 00:48:21.426
can cause painful burns on their feet
and exacerbate wounds and injuries.

334
00:48:32.145 --> 00:48:34.791
These poor environmental
conditions and overcrowding

335
00:48:34.816 --> 00:48:39.565
commonly lead to neurological disease where
incoordination, and head and neck tremors,

336
00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:43.550
are followed by paralysis,
convulsions, coma and death.

337
00:48:59.355 --> 00:49:02.049
When sick or injured ducks
are found by workers,

338
00:49:02.074 --> 00:49:04.064
they are killed by having
their necks broken.

339
00:49:18.429 --> 00:49:21.021
After 49 days, they're
collected into crates

340
00:49:21.046 --> 00:49:24.093
and forklifted onto trucks to
be sent to the slaughterhouse.

341
00:49:58.169 --> 00:50:00.035
Many don't survive the trip.

342
00:50:02.628 --> 00:50:04.363
Just like chickens and turkeys,

343
00:50:04.383 --> 00:50:06.870
ducks are hung by their feet
onto the slaughter line.

344
00:50:10.699 --> 00:50:14.409
The typical electric stun bath, once
again, is not always effective,

345
00:50:14.527 --> 00:50:17.418
with many birds having their
throats cut open while conscious

346
00:50:17.438 --> 00:50:22.054
and eventually dying from blood loss
or by drowning in the scalding tank.

347
00:50:37.464 --> 00:50:40.564
As of 2018, three
states in Australia

348
00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:43.918
have banned the recreational shooting
of wild ducks on cruelty grounds,

349
00:50:43.942 --> 00:50:46.991
but in Victoria, South
Australia and Tasmania,

350
00:50:47.563 --> 00:50:50.688
the practice remains legal
during an open season each year.

351
00:51:01.571 --> 00:51:05.173
The population of waterbirds in
Victoria has been steadily declining,

352
00:51:05.198 --> 00:51:09.223
in 2017 hitting the lowest
numbers in 34 years,

353
00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:12.753
yet the hunt continues under
justification of increased business

354
00:51:12.778 --> 00:51:15.290
in the rural communities
surrounding the wetlands,

355
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:18.766
and the general enjoyment and
satisfaction felt by the hunters.

356
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:39.913
Computer simulation estimates and the
observations of rescuers on the wetlands

357
00:51:39.938 --> 00:51:44.042
indicate that duck shooters leave at least
as many birds wounded and uncaptured

358
00:51:44.062 --> 00:51:47.522
as they kill and capture, amounting
to many thousands of ducks

359
00:51:47.547 --> 00:51:50.262
left to suffer or die
from untreated injuries.

360
00:51:58.022 --> 00:52:01.091
Additionally, the bodies of
many legally protected species

361
00:52:01.116 --> 00:52:03.609
such as the rare and
endangered Freckled Duck

362
00:52:03.634 --> 00:52:06.754
have been retrieved from the
wetlands during hunting season,

363
00:52:06.779 --> 00:52:10.139
with shooters either failing to
identify the species before firing,

364
00:52:10.164 --> 00:52:11.697
or just firing anyway.

365
00:52:19.823 --> 00:52:22.299
Around 80% of the world's
down and feathers

366
00:52:22.324 --> 00:52:26.252
used for items like jackets, sleeping
bags and bedding come from China,

367
00:52:26.448 --> 00:52:30.117
where the live plucking of ducks and
geese remains a common practice.

368
00:52:31.272 --> 00:52:34.136
This involves painfully ripping the
feathers out of the birds' skin,

369
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.285
leaving open and bloody wounds,

370
00:52:36.418 --> 00:52:40.002
a process repeated multiple times
before they are finally slaughtered.

371
00:52:42.584 --> 00:52:46.762
Even suppliers claiming certification
under the Responsible Down Standard

372
00:52:46.845 --> 00:52:49.229
have been found engaging in live plucking.

373
00:52:49.438 --> 00:52:52.456
Ultimately, it isn't possible to know
whether particular down products

374
00:52:52.535 --> 00:52:55.495
in Australia or elsewhere
come from these farms.

375
00:53:23.812 --> 00:53:26.578
Like humans, cows are
strongly maternal beings

376
00:53:26.598 --> 00:53:28.907
who form close bonds with their young,

377
00:53:28.932 --> 00:53:31.769
and must give birth in
order to produce milk.

378
00:53:32.755 --> 00:53:35.127
On dairy farms, they are
forcefully impregnated

379
00:53:35.152 --> 00:53:37.163
every year to keep this milk flowing,

380
00:53:37.188 --> 00:53:40.795
usually by artificial insemination
rather than natural mating,

381
00:53:40.815 --> 00:53:44.560
which requires workers to insert
their arm into the cow's anus

382
00:53:44.591 --> 00:53:48.908
to hold her cervix in place while injecting
her with semen collected from a bull.

383
00:53:53.664 --> 00:53:57.141
Their calves are taken away
mere hours after being born

384
00:53:57.166 --> 00:54:01.896
so that the milk intended for them can be
collected and sold for human consumption.

385
00:54:12.232 --> 00:54:14.632
Over the days following separation,

386
00:54:14.657 --> 00:54:16.456
the mothers bellow day and night,

387
00:54:16.532 --> 00:54:18.113
searching for their calves.

388
00:54:18.705 --> 00:54:21.471
They're known to grieve
for days or even weeks.

389
00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.904
The male calves, called bobby calves,

390
00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:28.300
are considered useless
to the dairy industry

391
00:54:28.325 --> 00:54:30.468
because they'll never be
able to produce milk.

392
00:54:30.498 --> 00:54:34.755
They are kept isolated for five days
before being herded onto a truck,

393
00:54:35.944 --> 00:54:37.652
and sent to the slaughterhouse.

394
00:54:39.869 --> 00:54:43.443
They can be withheld food for the
last 30 hours of their lives.

395
00:54:45.197 --> 00:54:48.922
Starved, confused and
desperate for affection,

396
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:52.736
they cry for their mothers from the
holding pens of the slaughterhouse

397
00:54:52.761 --> 00:54:55.007
where they'll be killed
the following morning.

398
00:55:57.539 --> 00:56:01.100
Those who avoid the stunner
or who are improperly stunned

399
00:56:01.125 --> 00:56:02.925
are killed while conscious.

400
00:56:18.995 --> 00:56:23.995
Around 700,000 male calves are slaughtered
as waste products of the dairy industry

401
00:56:24.372 --> 00:56:26.537
every year in Australia alone.

402
00:56:28.653 --> 00:56:32.983
A small number of male calves are
grown out for longer, up to 20 weeks,

403
00:56:33.081 --> 00:56:34.948
to be slaughtered for veal.

404
00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:44.363
The female calves are
also kept isolated,

405
00:56:44.388 --> 00:56:46.464
fed on powdered milk replacer,

406
00:56:46.489 --> 00:56:50.666
eventually to join the cycle after
being impregnated themselves.

407
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:31.003
2-3 times per day, the lactating cows
are herded into the milking shed

408
00:57:31.028 --> 00:57:34.095
and hooked up to industrial
milking machines.

409
00:57:45.878 --> 00:57:48.938
In natural conditions, they
can live up to 20 years.

410
00:57:48.963 --> 00:57:51.728
On dairy farms they last only 4 to 8 years,

411
00:57:53.945 --> 00:57:56.750
some - known as downers -
succumbing to the pressure

412
00:57:56.828 --> 00:58:00.074
of continuous impregnation and
producing up to 10 times more milk

413
00:58:00.133 --> 00:58:02.000
than they naturally would,

414
00:58:02.335 --> 00:58:05.980
the rest sent to slaughter when their
milk production begins to slow down

415
00:58:06.005 --> 00:58:08.440
or they become too injured to continue.

416
00:59:07.412 --> 00:59:12.412
Artificial insemination is preferred to
natural mating in the beef industry also.

417
00:59:13.136 --> 00:59:18.136
Calves raised for beef are subjected to a
variety of painful surgical procedures

418
00:59:18.255 --> 00:59:22.193
without anaesthesia, including
disbudding or dehorning...

419
00:59:29.012 --> 00:59:30.012
ear tagging...

420
00:59:33.151 --> 00:59:35.351
castration, either with a blade,

421
00:59:35.373 --> 00:59:37.088
or by a practice called ringing,

422
00:59:37.113 --> 00:59:41.275
where an elastic band is tightly clamped
around the base of the testicles,

423
00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:45.240
restricting blood blow until
eventually they rot and fall off.

424
00:59:47.744 --> 00:59:50.299
... and branding with a hot iron.

425
00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:59.974
Those who get sick typically lack
veterinary care and deteriorate quickly.

426
01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:28.785
Drugs including antibiotics, growth
hormones, vitamins and supplements,

427
01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:32.150
and progesterone for maintaining
pregnancy are injected...

428
01:00:34.786 --> 01:00:36.319
or inserted vaginally...

429
01:00:39.327 --> 01:00:40.327
or orally.

430
01:00:42.031 --> 01:00:45.991
These and other regular routines like
sorting or checking for pregnancy

431
01:00:46.058 --> 01:00:48.896
see the cattle forcefully
herded through the yard system

432
01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:52.854
into a restraint box called a
crush for individual attention.

433
01:01:37.429 --> 01:01:40.889
Around 40% of Australia's total beef supply

434
01:01:41.021 --> 01:01:44.701
and 80% of beef sold in
major domestic supermarkets

435
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:49.176
comes from cattle who have spent
the last 10-15% of their lives

436
01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:51.142
packed into barren feedlots,

437
01:01:51.264 --> 01:01:55.735
where they are fattened up with grain
before slaughter at 18 months of age.

438
01:02:47.567 --> 01:02:52.002
They're forced into the knockbox, from
which they will desperately try to escape.

439
01:04:10.986 --> 01:04:14.337
The captive bolt gun is the most
common method of stunning cows,

440
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:18.862
but the smaller guns especially are often
ineffective against such large animals,

441
01:04:18.887 --> 01:04:23.287
causing only pain and limited
mobility, but not unconsciousness.

442
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.453
A rifle is a less common alternative.

443
01:05:23.713 --> 01:05:27.471
In addition to witnessing the
animals before them being stunned,

444
01:05:27.496 --> 01:05:30.261
killed, and sometimes even the processing,

445
01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:34.779
in most cases they are also forced to
hear their fate from the next room.

446
01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:53.300
For cows slaughtered while pregnant,
the blood from their unborn calves,

447
01:05:53.327 --> 01:05:56.763
known as fetal calf serum
or fetal bovine serum,

448
01:05:56.842 --> 01:05:59.479
is of great value to the
pharmaceutical industry,

449
01:05:59.504 --> 01:06:02.337
fetching around $600 per litre.

450
01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:09.208
The hides of cows and bobby calves are sent
to tanneries to be turned into leather,

451
01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:12.149
the majority of which is
then exported overseas.

452
01:06:12.227 --> 01:06:13.670
There is a common misconception

453
01:06:13.695 --> 01:06:18.240
that leather is a by-product of the
meat industry intended to reduce waste.

454
01:06:18.334 --> 01:06:21.147
It is far more accurate to
say that it is a co-product,

455
01:06:21.163 --> 01:06:23.949
sometimes more economically
valuable than meat

456
01:06:23.974 --> 01:06:25.728
to the point where more and more animals

457
01:06:25.753 --> 01:06:28.619
are being killed for their skin
rather than for their flesh.

458
01:06:29.462 --> 01:06:33.549
Cheap leather for use in shoes,
handbags and other accessories

459
01:06:33.574 --> 01:06:37.323
is also imported to Australia,
the United States and Europe

460
01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:40.547
from developing countries
like India and Bangladesh.

461
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.362
As cows are considered sacred
by the Hindu religion,

462
01:06:44.387 --> 01:06:48.054
their slaughter is illegal
in 24 of India's 29 states.

463
01:06:48.278 --> 01:06:50.255
To be legally slaughtered for leather,

464
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.024
they must first be transported
hundreds or thousands of kilometres

465
01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:58.258
to one of the five exempt states or
across the border to Bangladesh.

466
01:06:58.283 --> 01:07:00.651
Depending on the route and
the number of animals

467
01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:05.277
- sometimes in the thousands - much
of this transport can occur on foot.

468
01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:11.327
In preparation, many have
shoes nailed into their feet

469
01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:14.312
and ropes threaded tightly
through their noses.

470
01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:19.732
Exhausted, starving and thirsty,
many collapse along the way,

471
01:07:21.379 --> 01:07:25.866
compelled to stand by having their nose
ropes pulled or their tails broken...

472
01:07:30.842 --> 01:07:34.785
being beaten with sticks, or having
chilli pepper rubbed into their eyes.

473
01:07:37.833 --> 01:07:41.195
For the rest of the journey, they
are crowded into and out of trucks,

474
01:07:43.211 --> 01:07:47.356
their horns piercing and gouging each
other and their bones often breaking.

475
01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:54.048
Those who make it to the slaughterhouse
are killed in front of each other

476
01:07:54.073 --> 01:07:55.699
without prior stunning,

477
01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.572
some even skinned alive.

478
01:08:03.762 --> 01:08:06.131
The hides are soaked in toxic chemicals

479
01:08:06.156 --> 01:08:09.235
known to cause cancer or
chronic skin diseases,

480
01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:10.685
often by children.

481
01:08:15.275 --> 01:08:17.323
The fundamental concept of rodeos

482
01:08:17.348 --> 01:08:22.281
is the physical control and domination
of weaker, more vulnerable beings.

483
01:08:22.535 --> 01:08:26.141
Calves, steers and bulls
are physically provoked

484
01:08:26.165 --> 01:08:28.129
for the entertainment of spectators

485
01:08:28.154 --> 01:08:32.443
in some 240 rodeo events held
across Australia every year.

486
01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:38.590
Normally quite docile animals,
they endure tail twisting,

487
01:08:47.798 --> 01:08:48.998
electric prodding

488
01:08:59.373 --> 01:09:01.928
and other physical abuse behind the scenes,

489
01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.782
as well as the use of metal spurs and
straps tightened around their abdomens,

490
01:09:16.807 --> 01:09:18.925
to make them "buck" and appear wild.

491
01:09:47.318 --> 01:09:51.619
With intensity and risk integral
factors for an entertaining show,

492
01:09:51.721 --> 01:09:53.204
injuries are inevitable.

493
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.411
Calf and steer roping involves the
lassoing of terrified animals

494
01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:35.777
as they try to run away, violently
jerking them to a halt,

495
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:40.411
and commonly resulting in bruising,
broken limbs, horns and even necks,

496
01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:45.515
ligament tearing, internal haemorrhaging
and subcutaneous tissue damage.

497
01:11:19.131 --> 01:11:21.543
'Winter lambing' is the
practice of impregnating sheep

498
01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:23.234
so that they give birth in winter months,

499
01:11:23.675 --> 01:11:27.106
meaning their lambs are weaned in
spring when pastures are most fertile.

500
01:11:27.285 --> 01:11:29.636
While this allows the lambs
to grow more quickly,

501
01:11:29.661 --> 01:11:34.367
it results in 10-15 million newborn
lambs - roughly one in every four -

502
01:11:34.392 --> 01:11:38.438
dying within 48 hours of birth
from exposure to the harsh cold.

503
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:42.698
For sheep farmers, this is still
preferable to the higher feed costs

504
01:11:42.723 --> 01:11:44.465
of lambing in warmer months.

505
01:11:47.343 --> 01:11:51.964
The Merino breed, accounting for around
80% of the wool produced in Australia,

506
01:11:51.989 --> 01:11:54.377
have been selectively bred
to have wrinkled skin

507
01:11:54.402 --> 01:11:56.205
resulting in excessive amounts of wool

508
01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:59.214
while making them much
more prone to flystrike.

509
01:11:59.657 --> 01:12:03.507
To reduce soiling and the risk of flystrike
for the lambs who make it to summer,

510
01:12:03.532 --> 01:12:05.958
their tails are docked or cut off entirely,

511
01:12:05.983 --> 01:12:08.481
and they are often mulesed
at the same time,

512
01:12:08.506 --> 01:12:11.008
which involves cutting off the
skin around their buttocks

513
01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.545
and the base of their
tail with metal shears.

514
01:12:14.474 --> 01:12:16.506
If the lambs are younger than 6 months,

515
01:12:16.531 --> 01:12:19.126
it is legal to do this
without any pain relief.

516
01:12:23.063 --> 01:12:27.026
Sheep shearers are paid by the number
of sheep shorn, not by the hour,

517
01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.629
so speed is prioritised over precision,

518
01:12:29.654 --> 01:12:32.866
and there is no requirement for
formal training or accreditation.

519
01:13:20.904 --> 01:13:24.037
After a few years, when they can
no longer produce enough wool

520
01:13:24.062 --> 01:13:28.106
to be considered profitable, the sheep are
sent to slaughter and sold as mutton,

521
01:13:28.236 --> 01:13:31.673
while lambs raised for meat are killed
between 4 and 12 months of age,

522
01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:34.881
far short of a natural
lifespan of 12-14 years.

523
01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:42.887
19 million of the 32 million sheep
killed each year in Australia

524
01:13:42.912 --> 01:13:44.324
go through saleyards,

525
01:13:44.558 --> 01:13:48.639
an intermediary between farms and
slaughterhouses or private buyers,

526
01:13:48.664 --> 01:13:52.586
where animals also including cattle,
calves, horses, poultry and pigs,

527
01:13:52.703 --> 01:13:53.970
are auctioned off.

528
01:13:55.737 --> 01:13:59.399
Heat stress, dehydration, exhaustion,
or pre-existing conditions

529
01:13:59.424 --> 01:14:02.034
are common causes of deaths at saleyards.

530
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.813
Most of the sheep are bought by
slaughterhouses for their meat.

531
01:14:11.854 --> 01:14:15.267
No animal at a slaughterhouse
walks willingly to their death.

532
01:14:47.752 --> 01:14:50.950
Again electrical stunning
proves regularly ineffective,

533
01:14:50.975 --> 01:14:54.092
causing only pain and terrifying
the animals even further

534
01:14:54.117 --> 01:14:55.530
in their final moments.

535
01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.262
Bolt gun stunning is no better.

536
01:16:11.552 --> 01:16:13.986
Regardless of how effective
stunning may appear,

537
01:16:14.011 --> 01:16:16.508
it's impossible to know with
certainty whether an animal

538
01:16:16.533 --> 01:16:20.090
has been rendered completely
unconscious and insensible to pain,

539
01:16:20.324 --> 01:16:24.190
or is merely paralysed and unable to
move, while still feeling everything.

540
01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:57.008
In their fear and desperation,
some manage to briefly escape,

541
01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.240
directly confronted with the
bodies of those before them,

542
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.841
before being forced back into the
race, knowing that they'll be next.

543
01:17:31.218 --> 01:17:34.372
Goats are farmed for dairy in
much the same way as cows,

544
01:17:34.393 --> 01:17:38.039
repeatedly impregnated to ensure
a continuous supply of milk.

545
01:17:38.065 --> 01:17:41.856
A niche industry in Australia
with only around 65 farms,

546
01:17:41.881 --> 01:17:45.075
goats' milk is marketed as a more
easily digestible alternative

547
01:17:45.101 --> 01:17:48.002
suitable for people with
allergies to cows' milk.

548
01:17:48.209 --> 01:17:51.992
Worldwide, more people drink the
milk of goats than any other animal.

549
01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.073
The male kids, unable
to ever produce milk,

550
01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:10.556
are generally considered waste products
and killed on farm shortly after birth

551
01:18:13.736 --> 01:18:17.483
while the female kids are grown to
become milk producers themselves,

552
01:18:17.508 --> 01:18:21.156
though some farms will raise and
sell their excess goats for meat.

553
01:18:27.682 --> 01:18:29.822
The lactating mothers
are milked twice daily

554
01:18:29.847 --> 01:18:32.007
for up to ten years before slaughter,

555
01:18:32.111 --> 01:18:35.974
at their peak producing 4 litres
of milk per day to be sold fresh

556
01:18:35.999 --> 01:18:40.021
or turned into cheese, butter,
ice-cream, yoghurt and soap.

557
01:18:50.779 --> 01:18:54.093
Australia is the largest exporter
of goat meat in the world,

558
01:18:54.118 --> 01:18:56.724
the majority of it going
to the United States.

559
01:18:56.867 --> 01:19:01.867
Only 10% comes from goats bred and farmed
for meat, the rest from rangeland goats,

560
01:19:02.353 --> 01:19:05.180
a wild breed originating
from escaped domestic goats

561
01:19:05.205 --> 01:19:07.825
brought to Australia by European settlers.

562
01:19:07.903 --> 01:19:10.823
These free-roaming goats are
captured and transported

563
01:19:10.848 --> 01:19:15.004
to feedlots known as goat depots, where
they are fattened prior to slaughter.

564
01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:47.829
Pregnant animals being sent
to slaughter is not uncommon,

565
01:19:47.855 --> 01:19:52.199
and inevitably, some will give birth on the
transport trucks or in the holding pens

566
01:19:52.226 --> 01:19:54.709
shortly before they are
herded to the kill floor,

567
01:19:55.022 --> 01:19:58.844
their babies left behind to die
from starvation or exposure,

568
01:19:58.869 --> 01:20:01.269
calling out for their dead mothers.

569
01:22:13.547 --> 01:22:16.973
Salmon is the most popularly
eaten fish in Australia,

570
01:22:17.038 --> 01:22:19.889
with almost 40,000 tonnes
consumed every year.

571
01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:22.613
They are farmed offshore
in underwater cages,

572
01:22:22.665 --> 01:22:25.813
primarily in bays on the south
and west coasts of Tasmania

573
01:22:25.838 --> 01:22:27.505
due to the cooler waters.

574
01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:31.478
Each cage can hold
up to 60,000 fish,

575
01:22:31.496 --> 01:22:35.280
transferred from the inland
hatchery at 12-18 months of age.

576
01:22:36.395 --> 01:22:39.518
As they grow, their space
within the cages decreases

577
01:22:39.543 --> 01:22:41.517
until they are packed tightly together.

578
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:47.660
A 2017 study on farmed salmon in Australia,
Norway, Chile, Scotland and Canada

579
01:22:48.141 --> 01:22:50.939
found that about half of the
fish in these farms are deaf

580
01:22:50.964 --> 01:22:55.308
as a result of accelerated growth rates
deforming their sound receptors.

581
01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:00.761
The world-heritage Macquarie
Harbour on Tasmania's west coast

582
01:23:00.786 --> 01:23:03.916
is home to the largest concentration
of fish farms in the country,

583
01:23:03.941 --> 01:23:08.177
with the salmon industry's three key
players - Tassal, Huon and Petuna -

584
01:23:08.202 --> 01:23:11.836
all owning several farms
comprising up to 2 dozen cages.

585
01:23:14.465 --> 01:23:19.465
In the one year period to September 2016,
over 21,000 tonnes of uneaten fish food

586
01:23:19.942 --> 01:23:22.866
and untold amounts of excrement
ended up in the harbour.

587
01:23:22.891 --> 01:23:26.766
Such high levels of pollution lead
to dangerously low levels of oxygen

588
01:23:26.791 --> 01:23:29.526
in the water and greater risks of disease,

589
01:23:29.551 --> 01:23:32.571
contributing to large numbers
of deaths within the farms.

590
01:23:35.257 --> 01:23:39.716
Numerous mass mortality
incidents from 2015 to 2018

591
01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:42.931
have been attributed to a mixture
of suffocation from low oxygen,

592
01:23:42.956 --> 01:23:44.722
human error, and disease.

593
01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:51.835
The largest of the three companies, Tassal,

594
01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:56.300
boasts an accepted survival rate
of 83% across all their farms.

595
01:23:56.793 --> 01:24:01.793
After 15-18 months in these ocean cages,
when they've reached about 7kg each,

596
01:24:01.951 --> 01:24:03.707
the salmon are sucked
up through a bore tube

597
01:24:03.732 --> 01:24:06.847
into the harvest vessel where they
are either immediately killed

598
01:24:06.872 --> 01:24:10.811
or transported alive in tanks to
the onshore processing facility.

599
01:24:12.237 --> 01:24:15.998
Barramundi are farmed in all states
of Australia except Tasmania.

600
01:24:16.023 --> 01:24:17.685
In the colder southern states,

601
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:20.925
they are raised with thousands
of others in small indoor tanks.

602
01:24:29.682 --> 01:24:31.406
While in the northern states,

603
01:24:31.431 --> 01:24:34.670
they're raised either in offshore
sea cages similar to salmon farms

604
01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:37.810
or in outdoor pond systems,
used also for trout.

605
01:24:43.027 --> 01:24:46.996
The supposed humane method of
harvesting and killing farmed fish

606
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:50.015
is to suck them into icy water
to freeze them to death.

607
01:25:04.737 --> 01:25:07.896
Far from humane, it is a
slow and painful death,

608
01:25:07.921 --> 01:25:10.146
sometimes taking half
an hour to kill.

609
01:25:37.478 --> 01:25:41.558
Fish killed for sashimi, a Japanese
delicacy favouring freshness,

610
01:25:41.583 --> 01:25:44.682
are stabbed in the head before
having their jugular vein cut open

611
01:25:44.707 --> 01:25:47.661
and then are put back into
the ice slurry to bleed out.

612
01:25:49.716 --> 01:25:51.836
Stores and restaurants displaying live fish

613
01:25:51.862 --> 01:25:53.778
allow customers intent on freshness

614
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:56.646
to choose which individuals
they would like killed.

615
01:26:01.733 --> 01:26:05.873
Three quarters of the seafood consumed in
Australia is imported from other countries,

616
01:26:05.897 --> 01:26:09.644
of which the most significant species
are prawns, salmon and tuna.

617
01:26:18.654 --> 01:26:22.131
Commercial fishing trawlers drag large
nets through the water behind them,

618
01:26:22.196 --> 01:26:24.800
indiscriminately capturing
all species in their wake.

619
01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:36.020
Around 85% of the world's fish stocks

620
01:26:36.045 --> 01:26:39.052
are now being fished to full
capacity or are overfished.

621
01:26:39.473 --> 01:26:40.680
At the current rate,

622
01:26:40.704 --> 01:26:44.577
it is anticipated that our oceans
will be void of fish by 2048.

623
01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:57.733
The rabbit farming industry in
Australia is a struggling one.

624
01:26:57.773 --> 01:27:01.635
Highly contagious diseases introduced
to eradicate wild rabbits,

625
01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:04.831
carried by insects, can quickly
wipe out entire farms,

626
01:27:04.856 --> 01:27:06.347
while others struggle to compete

627
01:27:06.372 --> 01:27:10.079
with the cheaper price of wild rabbits
trapped and killed by hunters.

628
01:27:10.705 --> 01:27:13.085
Farmed meat rabbits spend
their entire lives

629
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:15.665
in wire cages suspended above the floor,

630
01:27:15.690 --> 01:27:20.279
unable to exhibit any natural behaviours
like digging, hiding or jumping.

631
01:27:21.682 --> 01:27:24.110
A build-up of faeces on
the floor beneath them

632
01:27:24.135 --> 01:27:26.173
creates high levels of ammonia.

633
01:27:27.602 --> 01:27:31.369
Female rabbits kept for breeding can
be forced to live in these conditions

634
01:27:31.394 --> 01:27:34.661
for up to 56 weeks while
they produce 7 litters.

635
01:27:44.654 --> 01:27:49.654
Most of the rabbits, capable of living for
8-12 years, are killed at 12 weeks old.

636
01:27:55.113 --> 01:27:59.343
3 to 4 thousand rabbits are used for
scientific research and testing

637
01:27:59.368 --> 01:28:00.736
each year in Australia,

638
01:28:00.761 --> 01:28:03.799
many of them coming from
this facility in Victoria.

639
01:28:17.537 --> 01:28:20.982
Most fur products sold in Australia
are imported from overseas,

640
01:28:20.982 --> 01:28:22.994
much of that harvested
from rabbits.

641
01:28:23.177 --> 01:28:28.036
In 2015, clothing brand Akubra shut
down their Australian operations

642
01:28:28.061 --> 01:28:30.928
and began importing
rabbit fur from Europe.

643
01:28:38.105 --> 01:28:42.721
Australia also imports fur from China,
the world's largest fur exporter.

644
01:28:42.878 --> 01:28:46.848
Of ten rabbit fur farms visited
by an undercover investigator,

645
01:28:46.873 --> 01:28:50.674
half engaged in the practice of
plucking the fur from live rabbits,

646
01:28:50.699 --> 01:28:52.658
a process repeated every 3 months,

647
01:28:52.683 --> 01:28:55.418
between which the rabbits
live in wire cages.

648
01:28:55.761 --> 01:28:58.562
Plucking results in longer,
more profitable hair

649
01:28:58.587 --> 01:29:00.581
compared to shearing
or clipping.

650
01:29:02.744 --> 01:29:05.028
As rabbits age,
they grow less fur,

651
01:29:05.052 --> 01:29:08.521
and ultimately are hung up and
skinned for a final harvesting,

652
01:29:08.547 --> 01:29:10.480
sometimes while still alive.

653
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:17.122
12 rabbits are killed to make the
felt for just one Akubra hat.

654
01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:22.121
Worldwide, over one billion rabbits
are killed for their fur every year.

655
01:29:32.136 --> 01:29:34.277
Minks are a common source
of fur for clothing,

656
01:29:34.302 --> 01:29:37.035
accessories and even eyelash extensions.

657
01:29:37.429 --> 01:29:39.198
As there are no mink farms in Australia,

658
01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:41.650
their fur is imported from overseas.

659
01:29:42.575 --> 01:29:44.948
In the wild, they would individually occupy

660
01:29:44.975 --> 01:29:47.375
up to 2500 acres of wetland habitat.

661
01:29:48.154 --> 01:29:50.349
Despite generations of
being bred for fur,

662
01:29:50.374 --> 01:29:52.440
these naturally inquisitive
and solitary animals

663
01:29:52.465 --> 01:29:55.018
have been found to suffer
greatly in captivity,

664
01:29:55.233 --> 01:29:58.316
cramped in small wire cages where
chronic boredom and stress

665
01:29:58.341 --> 01:30:00.931
lead to frantic pacing and self-mutilation.

666
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.774
Minks used for breeding are kept in
these cages for four to five years,

667
01:30:07.799 --> 01:30:11.518
giving birth to a litter each
year of 3 or 4 surviving kittens,

668
01:30:11.755 --> 01:30:14.414
who are slaughtered and
skinned at 6 months old.

669
01:30:15.107 --> 01:30:18.019
Gas chambers or enclosed boxes
filled with engine exhaust

670
01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:19.810
are common ways of
killing the minks,

671
01:30:19.834 --> 01:30:23.861
but are not always lethal, resulting
in some waking up while being skinned.

672
01:30:30.676 --> 01:30:33.236
Anal electrocution or
simply breaking their necks

673
01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:34.611
are common alternatives.

674
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.815
After minks, foxes are the second
most commonly farmed animal for fur,

675
01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.768
facing many of the same problems.

676
01:31:14.245 --> 01:31:17.384
Chinese fur farmers claim that
their margins are so slim,

677
01:31:17.449 --> 01:31:18.992
they can't afford to kill foxes with

678
01:31:19.017 --> 01:31:22.066
anything but the most brutally
efficient of methods,

679
01:31:22.565 --> 01:31:26.839
with many foxes being skinned
alive to save time and effort.

680
01:31:32.462 --> 01:31:37.034
Introduced to Australia by British settlers
for their traditional sport of fox hunting

681
01:31:37.059 --> 01:31:39.945
and later to control the
spread of introduced rabbits,

682
01:31:39.969 --> 01:31:42.994
foxes are now classified as
pests across the country,

683
01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.379
with numbers estimated at over 7 million.

684
01:31:45.691 --> 01:31:47.081
The hunting and shooting of foxes

685
01:31:47.106 --> 01:31:50.117
on personally-owned land
is legal in all states.

686
01:32:03.065 --> 01:32:05.856
Often consumed accidentally
by native wildlife

687
01:32:05.881 --> 01:32:07.943
or companion animals like dogs,

688
01:32:07.968 --> 01:32:12.525
the most common method of reducing
numbers is the use of 1080 poison baits.

689
01:32:12.887 --> 01:32:15.959
1080 is colourless,
odourless and tasteless,

690
01:32:16.103 --> 01:32:19.503
causing slow, agonising
deaths to all its victims.

691
01:32:28.281 --> 01:32:30.583
While Australia, the EU and the US

692
01:32:30.608 --> 01:32:33.671
have banned the import
of dog and cat fur,

693
01:32:33.696 --> 01:32:36.734
investigations show that
Chinese dog and cat fur

694
01:32:36.759 --> 01:32:39.718
is frequently mislabelled
as fox, rabbit or mink.

695
01:32:39.743 --> 01:32:43.448
Each year in China, around
2 million dogs and cats

696
01:32:43.473 --> 01:32:47.023
are bred, stolen from homes,
or taken from the street,

697
01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:48.662
squeezed into wire cages

698
01:32:48.687 --> 01:32:52.115
and sometimes transported for
days without food or water,

699
01:32:52.139 --> 01:32:55.558
to be hanged, bled, beaten
or strangled to death

700
01:32:55.584 --> 01:32:57.117
or even skinned alive.

701
01:33:17.957 --> 01:33:21.648
Around 450,000 puppies are
sold in Australia each year.

702
01:33:21.906 --> 01:33:25.404
Around 85% come from
unregistered breeders,

703
01:33:25.445 --> 01:33:27.641
but with minimal oversight in place,

704
01:33:27.666 --> 01:33:30.640
even the registered breeders
may operate puppy factories,

705
01:33:30.698 --> 01:33:33.440
churning out both pure
and mixed-breed puppies

706
01:33:33.465 --> 01:33:35.732
for sale in pet stores or online.

707
01:33:37.944 --> 01:33:39.834
In these factories it can be entirely legal

708
01:33:39.859 --> 01:33:43.269
to keep a mother dog confined
to a barren concrete cell

709
01:33:43.294 --> 01:33:48.132
in a shed for 23 hours a day,
continually reimpregnated.

710
01:34:17.858 --> 01:34:20.116
They are denied love and companionship,

711
01:34:20.571 --> 01:34:22.756
treated instead as breeding machines.

712
01:34:24.164 --> 01:34:27.095
These cute puppies, sold
for thousands of dollars,

713
01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.186
often suffer from diseases
or other health conditions,

714
01:34:30.226 --> 01:34:32.336
or behavioural difficulties,

715
01:34:32.361 --> 01:34:35.812
as a result of the conditions
they were exposed to in the farm

716
01:34:35.864 --> 01:34:38.425
and generations of selective breeding.

717
01:34:39.442 --> 01:34:40.594
"Hi, how are you"

718
01:34:40.905 --> 01:34:43.141
"Yeah, good. Will you be getting
more of the golden retrievers in?"

719
01:34:43.166 --> 01:34:48.166
"Ah, yes, golden retrievers if I'm not
mistaken will be this coming Saturday"

720
01:34:48.871 --> 01:34:50.528
"This coming Saturday? Ah okay"

721
01:34:50.553 --> 01:34:52.748
"And... where do they come from?
Are they from a..."

722
01:34:52.852 --> 01:34:54.617
"We have our own breeder"

723
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:56.077
"Are they a puppy farm?"

724
01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:57.270
"Obviously no."

725
01:35:03.113 --> 01:35:04.846
"Oh they're so beautiful!"

726
01:35:06.324 --> 01:35:07.385
"And it's a good breeder?"

727
01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:08.833
"Yeah, definitely, they're registered"

728
01:35:08.858 --> 01:35:11.544
"So it's not like... I've been hearing
bad things about puppy farms...

729
01:35:11.569 --> 01:35:12.848
It's not a puppy farm?"
"Obviously no."

730
01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:15.655
"Puppy farms you will get
puppies really sick"

731
01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:16.868
"Sick puppies."

732
01:35:27.232 --> 01:35:32.232
Meanwhile, an estimated 200-250,000
surrendered or stray dogs and cats

733
01:35:33.281 --> 01:35:37.480
are euthanised each year in shelters
and pounds across the country,

734
01:35:37.505 --> 01:35:40.638
the vast majority of them
healthy but unwanted.

735
01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:58.009
Despite numerous widely publicised
scandals in recent years,

736
01:35:58.034 --> 01:36:01.069
greyhound racing continues
to be a large and powerful

737
01:36:01.094 --> 01:36:04.974
gambling and entertainment industry
in Australia and around the world.

738
01:36:04.999 --> 01:36:07.468
The rapid acceleration and extreme speed

739
01:36:07.493 --> 01:36:10.655
at which these large dogs
chase the lure around a track

740
01:36:10.786 --> 01:36:13.931
inevitably results in
collisions, falls and injuries,

741
01:36:14.113 --> 01:36:18.476
the most frequent being muscle tears,
ligament ruptures and tarsal fractures.

742
01:36:18.945 --> 01:36:22.854
Each week on Australian tracks up
to 200 dogs are reported injured

743
01:36:23.218 --> 01:36:26.638
with an estimated 6 to 10
greyhounds either dying on track

744
01:36:26.857 --> 01:36:28.653
or being put down afterwards.

745
01:36:28.979 --> 01:36:32.538
Greyhounds have a natural
lifespan of 12-14 years.

746
01:36:32.563 --> 01:36:36.724
Racing greyhounds begin their
'careers' at around 18 months of age,

747
01:36:36.855 --> 01:36:39.693
and finish by the time they
are 4 and a half years old.

748
01:36:39.858 --> 01:36:41.411
In New South Wales they have a career

749
01:36:41.436 --> 01:36:45.445
that lasts, on average, for only 363 days.

750
01:36:45.713 --> 01:36:50.713
Between 13,000 and 17,000 young greyhounds
are killed annually in Australia.

751
01:36:51.290 --> 01:36:54.042
Of the 97000 greyhounds
bred in New South Wales

752
01:36:54.067 --> 01:36:56.830
in the 12 year period to 2016,

753
01:36:57.005 --> 01:37:01.430
50-70% or more were killed because
they were considered too slow

754
01:37:01.455 --> 01:37:03.351
or unsuitable for racing.

755
01:37:03.605 --> 01:37:05.187
There is a growing body of evidence

756
01:37:05.212 --> 01:37:08.209
showing greyhounds are frequently
killed in inhumane ways,

757
01:37:08.234 --> 01:37:11.718
with trainers preferring the cheaper
option of gunshot or bludgeoning

758
01:37:11.744 --> 01:37:13.863
over paying for a vet to euthanise.

759
01:37:14.157 --> 01:37:17.390
The dogs' bodies may then be dumped
in pits on private properties

760
01:37:17.415 --> 01:37:19.082
or scattered in bushland.

761
01:37:20.654 --> 01:37:24.263
The use of live animals as bait when
training greyhounds to chase the lure,

762
01:37:24.288 --> 01:37:26.966
though illegal, has been
found to be widespread,

763
01:37:26.991 --> 01:37:29.751
with a 2015 New South Wales Inquiry

764
01:37:29.776 --> 01:37:32.675
being told that 85 to
90 percent of trainers

765
01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:34.300
engage in the practice.

766
01:37:46.502 --> 01:37:51.502
Untold numbers of terrified piglets,
rabbits, possums, chickens and kittens

767
01:37:51.592 --> 01:37:53.576
have been torn apart for
the sake of teaching

768
01:37:53.601 --> 01:37:57.334
otherwise gentle, sleepy
animals to run around a track.

769
01:38:01.851 --> 01:38:05.423
Horses are not skeletally mature
until around 5 years of age,

770
01:38:05.443 --> 01:38:08.431
but commonly their racing careers
begin when they're only 2

771
01:38:08.456 --> 01:38:10.276
due to the lure of higher prize money

772
01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:12.342
and a quicker return on investment.

773
01:38:12.819 --> 01:38:15.273
This drastically increases
the risk of injuries,

774
01:38:15.298 --> 01:38:17.941
with up to 80% suffering
from shin soreness,

775
01:38:17.966 --> 01:38:19.779
or dorsal metacarpal disease.

776
01:38:20.427 --> 01:38:23.042
Post-race examinations have
found a high prevalence

777
01:38:23.067 --> 01:38:25.234
of blood in the horses'
windpipes and lungs,

778
01:38:25.258 --> 01:38:28.720
along with an increasing frequency
and severity of stomach ulcers

779
01:38:28.745 --> 01:38:31.006
as training and racing progressed.

780
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:35.637
On the track, they are painfully
whipped to encourage greater speeds.

781
01:38:35.638 --> 01:38:38.962
Race rules limit whipping in the
earlier stages of the race,

782
01:38:38.962 --> 01:38:41.334
but in the last hundred metres
when the horses are fatigued

783
01:38:41.358 --> 01:38:43.983
and less able to respond,
there are no limits

784
01:38:44.009 --> 01:38:46.835
and they are often whipped
relentlessly until the finish line.

785
01:38:47.666 --> 01:38:51.875
Jumps racing is statistically 19 times
more dangerous than flat racing,

786
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.377
with violent falls a regular occurrence.

787
01:39:04.048 --> 01:39:06.717
Roughly half of the horses
involved in jumps races

788
01:39:06.742 --> 01:39:08.666
each year in Australia disappear,

789
01:39:08.691 --> 01:39:11.555
quietly exiting the industry
in unknown circumstances,

790
01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.762
never to race or be heard from again,

791
01:39:13.787 --> 01:39:15.120
or killed on track,

792
01:39:15.145 --> 01:39:18.271
with green screens erected to
obscure the view of racegoers.

793
01:39:33.119 --> 01:39:37.754
Nationally, 11-12,000 racing horses
are newly registered each year,

794
01:39:37.779 --> 01:39:39.794
while roughly the same
number leave the industry,

795
01:39:39.819 --> 01:39:44.590
largely as a result of poor performance,
unsuitable temperaments or injuries.

796
01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:46.905
Many of these end up at knackeries,

797
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:50.351
where they are killed for pet food
or to feed racing greyhounds.

798
01:39:53.214 --> 01:39:56.747
Others end up at one of two
licensed horse abattoirs

799
01:39:56.772 --> 01:39:59.295
that export horsemeat
for human consumption.

800
01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:18.576
Horses are also used in rodeos.

801
01:40:49.875 --> 01:40:53.738
Camels were brought to Australia in
the 1800s to be used for transport,

802
01:40:53.803 --> 01:40:57.002
then released into the wild following
the advent of automobiles.

803
01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:01.320
By 2008, their population was
estimated at around 600,000,

804
01:41:01.443 --> 01:41:03.886
leading the government to
establish a culling project

805
01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:06.197
that effectively halved their numbers,

806
01:41:06.222 --> 01:41:08.797
primarily by shooting them from helicopters

807
01:41:08.822 --> 01:41:12.110
but also by rounding them up and
trucking them to slaughterhouses

808
01:41:12.135 --> 01:41:14.776
for export to the United
States and Middle East,

809
01:41:14.801 --> 01:41:16.515
a practice which continues today.

810
01:41:18.024 --> 01:41:22.028
Having spent their entire lives
roaming freely without human contact,

811
01:41:22.053 --> 01:41:24.123
the sudden confinement
and forceful handling

812
01:41:24.148 --> 01:41:25.736
is completely foreign to them.

813
01:42:03.574 --> 01:42:05.962
An increasing number of
camels caught in the wild

814
01:42:05.987 --> 01:42:09.167
are being diverted to camel
dairies, an expanding industry

815
01:42:09.192 --> 01:42:12.123
that promotes itself as a healthier
alternative to cow milk products

816
01:42:12.150 --> 01:42:15.022
and a less wasteful alternative
to aerial culling.

817
01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:23.757
Between 6 and 10 million animals

818
01:42:23.782 --> 01:42:27.395
are used for research and testing
purposes in Australia every year,

819
01:42:27.511 --> 01:42:29.426
including 1-2 million mice.

820
01:42:30.061 --> 01:42:34.208
Many of these experiments involve live
surgical procedures without pain relief,

821
01:42:34.233 --> 01:42:36.500
or exposure to toxins or diseases.

822
01:42:37.441 --> 01:42:41.032
Ultimately, all mice subjected to
research or testing will be killed,

823
01:42:41.057 --> 01:42:43.448
as they cannot legally be
released from the lab.

824
01:42:43.643 --> 01:42:47.661
Carbon dioxide gassing, or overdosing
with the anaesthetic isoflurane

825
01:42:47.686 --> 01:42:50.544
through gas or injection, are
two common ways of killing mice

826
01:42:50.569 --> 01:42:52.492
when they have served their purpose.

827
01:43:12.982 --> 01:43:15.753
These days, scientific
exploration and discovery

828
01:43:15.818 --> 01:43:18.269
deals with nuances of human physiology,

829
01:43:18.314 --> 01:43:20.683
of which animals are not
appropriate models.

830
01:43:20.945 --> 01:43:24.924
A 2015 study by The National Institutes
of Health in the United States

831
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:27.686
found that a staggering 95% of all drugs

832
01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:30.664
that are shown to be safe and
effective in animal testing

833
01:43:30.691 --> 01:43:32.758
go on to fail in human trials.

834
01:43:33.022 --> 01:43:35.764
Uncritical reliance on the
results of animal tests

835
01:43:35.808 --> 01:43:38.619
in disregard of potentially
more accurate alternatives

836
01:43:38.707 --> 01:43:40.538
utilising human tissue and cells,

837
01:43:40.563 --> 01:43:43.722
cadavers, simulators and
computational models,

838
01:43:43.792 --> 01:43:47.399
may have cost the health and lives
of tens of thousands of humans...

839
01:43:47.719 --> 01:43:49.386
and billions of animals.

840
01:43:55.461 --> 01:43:58.394
Hundreds of macaques,
marmosets and baboons

841
01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:01.544
are provided annually to
Australian research laboratories

842
01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:04.245
by three government-funded
breeding facilities.

843
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:07.236
Hidden from public sight
behind intense security,

844
01:44:07.261 --> 01:44:11.011
these laboratories carry out a
variety of biomedical experiments

845
01:44:11.036 --> 01:44:14.444
on these highly intelligent
animals before discarding them.

846
01:44:14.574 --> 01:44:17.058
Other primates are held
captive in circuses,

847
01:44:17.083 --> 01:44:19.680
where they are released from the
extreme boredom of their cage

848
01:44:19.705 --> 01:44:21.772
only to perform for spectators...

849
01:44:24.556 --> 01:44:26.400
or, in zoos.

850
01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.631
Captive lions and tigers in
Australia serve the same purpose,

851
01:45:06.656 --> 01:45:09.300
living a life of boredom and frustration

852
01:45:09.325 --> 01:45:11.428
for the entertainment of paying visitors.

853
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:21.662
While on the surface, exhibits showcasing
these and other exotic animals

854
01:45:21.687 --> 01:45:25.696
may inspire wonder and excitement,
few patrons observe long enough

855
01:45:25.721 --> 01:45:28.415
to recognise the repetitiveness
of their behaviour,

856
01:45:28.532 --> 01:45:33.146
signs of a psychological condition
common across all animals in captivity,

857
01:45:33.171 --> 01:45:34.641
dubbed zoochosis.

858
01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:38.640
In the tropical heat of Queensland,

859
01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:42.326
Sea World hosts Australia's
only captive polar bears.

860
01:45:42.351 --> 01:45:44.548
These animals are naturally adapted

861
01:45:44.573 --> 01:45:47.595
for freezing Arctic conditions
and have been found in the wild

862
01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:51.245
to swim over 70km in only 24 hours

863
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:55.117
with an average travel
range of 3000km per year.

864
01:45:55.414 --> 01:45:57.449
Here, they are confined to an enclosure

865
01:45:57.474 --> 01:46:01.416
roughly 30 by 40 metres wide
for their entire lives.

866
01:46:19.467 --> 01:46:22.067
Seal shows are a popular
attraction at zoos,

867
01:46:22.092 --> 01:46:25.999
with seals taught to perform tricks for
food in front of a large audience.

868
01:46:26.148 --> 01:46:28.762
"And that's a guarantee that your
seafood comes from a fishery

869
01:46:28.787 --> 01:46:32.276
that helps protect fish stocks,
jobs, and the environment."

870
01:46:32.301 --> 01:46:35.773
Off stage, they languish in small
pens like any other zoo animal,

871
01:46:35.798 --> 01:46:39.877
swimming constantly in repetitive
circles or crying out in distress.

872
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:52.109
In the wild, dolphins are known to
travel up to 65km - 40 miles - a day,

873
01:46:52.421 --> 01:46:55.030
and are constantly on the
move - foraging for food,

874
01:46:55.055 --> 01:46:57.246
playing and fighting within their pods.

875
01:46:57.403 --> 01:46:59.513
They share with humans and great apes alone

876
01:46:59.538 --> 01:47:03.492
the trait of self-awareness, with
evidence of intuition and empathy.

877
01:47:03.773 --> 01:47:05.596
There is no captive situation

878
01:47:05.621 --> 01:47:09.215
that can provide for all the behavioural
needs of these highly intelligent,

879
01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:11.394
cognitively complex animals.

880
01:47:11.419 --> 01:47:14.321
Around 80% of Sea World
Australia's dolphins

881
01:47:14.346 --> 01:47:17.097
have been bred in captivity
and can never be released,

882
01:47:17.141 --> 01:47:21.187
their entire lives spent performing
daily for the reward of food.

883
01:47:21.637 --> 01:47:23.976
Achieving the right level
of hunger prior to shows

884
01:47:24.001 --> 01:47:27.181
is a crucial consideration
for a good performance,

885
01:47:27.462 --> 01:47:31.026
in what is arguably the park's
most popular attraction.

886
01:47:31.495 --> 01:47:36.023
With over $133 million in
admission fees annually,

887
01:47:36.048 --> 01:47:38.503
less than 1 percent is spent on their

888
01:47:38.528 --> 01:47:42.743
heavily promoted research, rescue
and rehabilitation initiatives.

889
01:47:43.871 --> 01:47:46.804
Australia's federal
government ruled in 1985

890
01:47:46.829 --> 01:47:49.002
that no more dolphinariums
be established,

891
01:47:49.092 --> 01:47:51.174
and that existing ones
should be phased out,

892
01:47:51.199 --> 01:47:54.018
after receiving evidence
that cetaceans in captivity

893
01:47:54.043 --> 01:47:58.017
suffer from stress, behavioural
abnormalities, breeding problems,

894
01:47:58.042 --> 01:48:00.679
high mortality rates and shorter lifespans,

895
01:48:00.747 --> 01:48:04.676
even though at initial glance they may
seem content with their conditions.

896
01:48:05.455 --> 01:48:07.594
Today, just two facilities remain,

897
01:48:07.619 --> 01:48:10.157
able to continue operating
because of a loophole

898
01:48:10.182 --> 01:48:13.621
that allowed them to keep and
display animals born in captivity,

899
01:48:13.646 --> 01:48:16.672
including those bred from
rescued wild dolphins

900
01:48:16.697 --> 01:48:20.415
who themselves are required to
be rehabilitated and released.

901
01:48:20.527 --> 01:48:23.377
This practice of rescuing,
breeding and releasing

902
01:48:23.402 --> 01:48:25.962
allows these parks to
keep the gene pool strong

903
01:48:25.987 --> 01:48:30.362
to ensure their shows can continue
and their gates can remain open.

904
01:48:32.666 --> 01:48:34.801
While Australian dolphin parks are unable

905
01:48:34.846 --> 01:48:39.060
to capture and import healthy wild
dolphins, this remains a reality

906
01:48:39.085 --> 01:48:42.009
of the animal entertainment
industry elsewhere in the world,

907
01:48:42.034 --> 01:48:46.248
with the coastal Japanese town of
Taiji a common point of capture.

908
01:48:46.397 --> 01:48:48.684
Every year from September to March,

909
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:51.661
thousands of dolphins and
other small cetaceans

910
01:48:51.686 --> 01:48:54.551
are herded into a quiet cove at Taiji

911
01:48:54.576 --> 01:48:57.144
and brutally slaughtered
by local fishermen,

912
01:48:57.169 --> 01:49:00.509
who see them either as a
source of income or as pests.

913
01:49:00.535 --> 01:49:03.630
Dolphin trainers have been
observed assisting fishermen

914
01:49:03.656 --> 01:49:04.926
in herding the dolphins,

915
01:49:04.951 --> 01:49:07.710
picking out a select few to
be spared from the slaughter

916
01:49:07.737 --> 01:49:12.223
and instead transported to aquariums
and dolphin parks around the world.

917
01:49:16.395 --> 01:49:19.182
If the greatness of a nation
and its moral progress

918
01:49:19.207 --> 01:49:21.808
can be judged by the way
its animals are treated...

919
01:49:21.833 --> 01:49:24.166
what does that say about Australia?

920
01:49:27.905 --> 01:49:29.703
What does it say
about New Zealand?

921
01:49:33.417 --> 01:49:34.617
The United States?

922
01:49:39.098 --> 01:49:40.098
Canada?

923
01:49:41.879 --> 01:49:42.879
Mexico?

924
01:49:45.113 --> 01:49:46.379
The United Kingdom?

925
01:49:48.157 --> 01:49:49.157
Israel?

926
01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:52.060
Spain?

927
01:49:54.557 --> 01:49:57.223
What does it say about
us, as a species?

928
01:49:58.592 --> 01:50:03.592
In our entire recorded history, 619
million humans have been killed by war.

929
01:50:04.391 --> 01:50:07.466
We kill the same number
of animals every 3 days,

930
01:50:07.755 --> 01:50:10.727
and this isn't even including
fish and other sea creatures

931
01:50:10.752 --> 01:50:13.678
whose deaths are so great they
are only measured in tonnes.

932
01:50:24.074 --> 01:50:27.064
But before we kill them,
we have to breed them...

933
01:50:29.877 --> 01:50:31.611
Confine and exploit them,

934
01:50:32.097 --> 01:50:33.145
for food...

935
01:50:34.552 --> 01:50:35.619
entertainment...

936
01:50:37.265 --> 01:50:38.265
clothing...

937
01:50:39.930 --> 01:50:41.028
and research.

938
01:50:42.186 --> 01:50:44.853
Their entire lives, from birth to death,

939
01:50:44.879 --> 01:50:48.278
are controlled by industries
who care only for profit.

940
01:50:50.096 --> 01:50:51.326
An empire...

941
01:50:52.015 --> 01:50:53.098
of suffering...

942
01:50:53.508 --> 01:50:54.603
and blood.

943
01:50:55.204 --> 01:50:59.074
Paid for by consumers who are told
that their treatment was ethical.

944
01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:01.712
Free range, local, organic.

945
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:03.748
That their deaths were humane,

946
01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:07.112
that cruelty to animals doesn't
happen here in our country,

947
01:51:07.316 --> 01:51:10.394
and if it does, our
government, our authorities,

948
01:51:10.419 --> 01:51:12.486
will find it and stamp it out.

949
01:51:13.268 --> 01:51:16.907
And us, as consumers, have little
reason to think otherwise,

950
01:51:17.539 --> 01:51:20.055
because to eat and use animals is normal,

951
01:51:20.134 --> 01:51:21.601
we've done it forever.

952
01:51:22.176 --> 01:51:25.465
Because the products for
sale on supermarket shelves

953
01:51:25.591 --> 01:51:28.850
are so far removed from the
individuals who once existed,

954
01:51:28.981 --> 01:51:30.412
some only briefly,

955
01:51:30.821 --> 01:51:33.021
some for years without reprieve.

956
01:51:34.263 --> 01:51:38.798
Individuals who share with us and our
companion animals we love so dearly,

957
01:51:38.876 --> 01:51:41.374
our capacity to feel love.

958
01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:43.900
Happiness.

959
01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:48.290
Grief and mourning.

960
01:51:49.371 --> 01:51:52.238
Who share with us, our capacity to suffer.

961
01:51:58.932 --> 01:52:00.927
Our desire to live,

962
01:52:01.588 --> 01:52:02.588
to be free,

963
01:52:05.735 --> 01:52:07.468
to be seen not as objects,

964
01:52:08.061 --> 01:52:10.154
not for our utility to others,

965
01:52:10.179 --> 01:52:12.943
but for who we are
as individuals.

966
01:52:13.324 --> 01:52:14.842
Beings in our own right,

967
01:52:14.867 --> 01:52:16.639
not units of production.

968
01:52:16.664 --> 01:52:17.862
Not stock.

969
01:52:17.887 --> 01:52:21.154
He, she, and they, not "it".

970
01:52:22.357 --> 01:52:23.460
The truth is,

971
01:52:23.563 --> 01:52:26.696
there is no humane way to kill
someone who wants to live.

972
01:52:27.493 --> 01:52:29.582
It is not a question of treatment,

973
01:52:29.634 --> 01:52:31.706
or better ways of doing the wrong thing.

974
01:52:32.025 --> 01:52:34.825
Bigger cages, smaller
stocking densities,

975
01:52:34.853 --> 01:52:36.253
or less painful gas.

976
01:52:38.566 --> 01:52:41.009
We tell ourselves that they
have lived good lives,

977
01:52:41.034 --> 01:52:42.879
and in the end, they
don't know what's coming

978
01:52:42.932 --> 01:52:44.233
and don't feel a thing.

979
01:52:44.696 --> 01:52:45.696
But they do.

980
01:52:45.828 --> 01:52:48.384
In their final hours, minutes and seconds,

981
01:52:48.409 --> 01:52:51.233
there is always fear, there is always pain.

982
01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.806
The smells of blood.

983
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.276
The screaming of other
members of their species,

984
01:52:56.445 --> 01:52:58.598
with whom they have shared their lives.

985
01:52:59.254 --> 01:53:01.551
Never a willingness or desire to die,

986
01:53:02.005 --> 01:53:04.054
but rather, a desperation to live,

987
01:53:05.121 --> 01:53:07.476
a frantic fight to their last breath.

988
01:53:08.393 --> 01:53:10.625
And never are they shown mercy or kindness,

989
01:53:10.807 --> 01:53:11.873
instead mocked,

990
01:53:13.122 --> 01:53:14.277
laughed at,

991
01:53:15.027 --> 01:53:15.887
kicked,

992
01:53:15.912 --> 01:53:16.767
beaten,

993
01:53:20.297 --> 01:53:21.528
tossed like ragdolls,

994
01:53:21.553 --> 01:53:24.949
or sent into a mincer because
they were born the wrong sex.

995
01:53:26.434 --> 01:53:28.034
We take their children.

996
01:53:29.474 --> 01:53:30.941
We take their freedom.

997
01:53:32.671 --> 01:53:34.005
We take their lives,

998
01:53:34.141 --> 01:53:37.038
sending them healthy and
whole into a slaughterhouse

999
01:53:37.063 --> 01:53:39.936
to come out as packaged
pieces on the other side,

1000
01:53:40.165 --> 01:53:43.335
and we tell ourselves that
somehow, along the way,

1001
01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.816
something humane and ethical happened.

1002
01:53:46.459 --> 01:53:48.798
And in the process, we harm ourselves.

1003
01:53:48.838 --> 01:53:52.040
"The World Health Organisation
publishing a report this morning

1004
01:53:52.065 --> 01:53:55.213
on the dangers of processed
and red meat..."

1005
01:53:55.754 --> 01:53:57.228
We destroy our environment,

1006
01:53:57.253 --> 01:54:02.253
emitting through animal agriculture more
greenhouse gases than any other industry,

1007
01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.704
tearing down our forests and
slaughtering our native animals

1008
01:54:05.729 --> 01:54:07.331
to make room for farms.

1009
01:54:08.958 --> 01:54:11.442
The world's cattle alone
consume a quantity of food

1010
01:54:11.466 --> 01:54:15.306
equal to the caloric needs
of 8.7 billion humans,

1011
01:54:15.842 --> 01:54:19.636
and yet one in nine
humans - 795 million -

1012
01:54:19.881 --> 01:54:24.881
suffer from chronic undernourishment,
and 844 million lack clean water

1013
01:54:25.344 --> 01:54:28.944
while 1000 litres are used
to produce 1 litre of milk

1014
01:54:28.969 --> 01:54:32.217
and 15,000 litres for one kilogram of beef.

1015
01:54:33.364 --> 01:54:36.697
And yet we continue to
justify animal agriculture

1016
01:54:36.722 --> 01:54:40.485
by claiming that it's normal,
necessary and natural.

1017
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:43.416
That the animal kingdom, or
certain species within it,

1018
01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.139
are inferior to ourselves, because they
lack our specific type of intelligence,

1019
01:54:48.164 --> 01:54:51.126
because they're weaker and
cannot defend themselves.

1020
01:54:51.179 --> 01:54:53.976
We believe that, in our
apparent superiority,

1021
01:54:54.028 --> 01:54:57.798
we have earned the right to exercise
power, authority and dominion

1022
01:54:57.823 --> 01:55:02.784
over those we perceive to be inferior,
for our own short-sighted ends.

1023
01:55:03.754 --> 01:55:06.879
It is a justification that
has been used before.

1024
01:55:07.259 --> 01:55:09.492
By the white man, to
enslave the black,

1025
01:55:09.517 --> 01:55:11.674
or to take their land and their children.

1026
01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:14.727
By the Nazis, to murder the Jews.

1027
01:55:15.356 --> 01:55:17.679
By men, to silence and oppress women.

1028
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:22.088
Are we doomed to repeat
history over and over?

1029
01:55:22.812 --> 01:55:26.197
Does this superiority complex,
this pure selfishness,

1030
01:55:26.222 --> 01:55:28.483
define who we are as a species?

1031
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:31.458
Or are we capable of something more?
